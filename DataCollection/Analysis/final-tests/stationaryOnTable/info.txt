These test are done when the phone is stationary on table inside the room. 20kHz is the pilot tone. SR=48000

 The frequency vectors have a per-bin resolution of 11.71875 Hz.

We have found that the right bandwidth of the pilot tone itself with no motion is ~35.15625 Hz, which can vary from 11.71875-35.15625 Hz (1-3 bins on the right side of the tone)
depending on the quality of the sound system.
Thus, we consider a “motion event” to occur when there is a frequency shift bandwidth of 4 or more bins.
